- **Bash:** Used for scripting to create a countdown timer.

## Description

This project is a simple Countdown Timer designed to provide a countdown from a given number to zero. It includes functionalities for decrementing the number and pausing for a second between each decrement through a Bash script interface.

## Project Structure

### Bash Shell Script

The `countdown.sh` script serves as the command-line interface to start the countdown. Key functionalities include:

- Accepting a number as an argument.
- Decrementing the number until it reaches zero.
- Pausing for a second between each decrement.

#### Benefits of Using Bash

- **Ease of Use:** Utilizes familiar command-line interfaces for quick countdown creation.
- **Portability:** Bash scripts can be run on any Unix-based system without requiring any additional software.

## How to Use

### Running the Bash Script

1. **Grant Execution Permission**: Ensure the script has executable permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x countdown.sh
   ```

2. **Execute the Script**: Start the countdown by running the script with a number as an argument:
   ```bash
   ./countdown.sh 10
   ```

### Navigation within the Script

- **Main Menu**:
  - The script automatically starts the countdown when run with a number as an argument.
